## 🧠 How the Strength Levels Are Calculated

The GainsCulator uses a strength table based on the percentage of your bodyweight you can lift. This table is different for males and females and covers six levels:

- **Noob**: 🚶 Just starting out? Don’t worry; we’ve all been there!
- **Beginner**: 🏋️ You’re making progress!
- **Intermediate**: 💪 Getting strong!
- **Advanced**: 🔥 You're on fire!
- **Elite**: 👑 You’re in the top tier!
- **Freak**: 💥 You're an absolute beast!

For example:
- **Bench Press (Male)**: 
   - Less than 1x bodyweight is **Noob**.
   - Exactly 1x bodyweight is **Beginner**.
   - 1.0-1.5x is **Intermediate**.
   - 1.5-2.0x is **Advanced**.
   - 2.0-2.25x is **Elite**.
   - Over 2.25x is **Freak**.

The calculations are based on these percentages and are adjusted for gender differences.
